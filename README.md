# Programming and Scripting - Practice Repository

This repository contains code, exercises, and experiments related to the Programming and Scripting module of the Science in Computing (Data Analytics) course at Atlantic Technological University (ATU).

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to practice and reinforce concepts learned in class, test code snippets, and explore various Python programming techniques. It serves as a personal sandbox to experiment with new ideas, reproduce lecture examples, and gain hands-on experience with Python.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders by week, following the module's structure:

- **week01**: Introduction to Python, setting up the environment
- **week02**: Basic data types, variables, and operators
- **week03**: Control flow, loops, and conditionals
- **week04**: Functions and modules
- **week05**: Working with files and error handling
- **week06**: Data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries)

... and so on, evolving alongside the course.

## How to Use

Clone the repository and navigate to the relevant week or topic to see example code and practice scripts:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elainecazetta/pands-mywork.git
cd pands-mywork
```

Each week may contain Jupyter Notebooks, Python scripts, and Markdown files with notes explaining concepts and documenting learning progress.

## Learning Journey

This repository reflects an ongoing learning process. Code may change, improve, or even break as new concepts are explored. Mistakes are embraced as part of the learning path, with the goal of developing strong problem-solving and programming skills.
